TimeDatePicker is a simple Android library containing several configurable time/date picker views and dialogs.

This library was mainly created as a result of problems I ran into setting the colors/themes for Android's default time/date pickers to use. It will also try to combat some of the lack of intuitiveness created by the circular time picker (numbers immediately changing from hours to minutes after selection is nowhere near obvious to new users) while maintaining compatibility back to Android 4.0.3 (ICS).

An APK of the sample app can be downloaded [here](/../../releases).

## Usage

### Setup

The Gradle dependency is available through jCenter, which is used by default in Android Studio. To add the module to your project, copy this line into the dependencies section of your build.gradle file.

```gradle
implementation 'me.jfenn:timedatepicker:0.0.6'
```

### Doing Stuff

Proper documentation/instructions will be added later.
